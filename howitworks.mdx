### The Data Source Ecosystem

Pond3r intelligently connects to multiple specialized data sources to provide a complete picture:

- The Graph Protocol: Our primary source for on-chain data, accessing hundreds of subgraphs across various blockchains and protocols. The Graph indexes blockchain data and makes it queryable through GraphQL.
  _Example use: When you ask about DEX volumes, liquidity positions, or protocol metrics, Pond3r navigates The Graph's extensive subgraph ecosystem._
- Pyth Network: A specialized oracle network that provides high-fidelity price data. Pond3r uses Pyth to retrieve real-time asset prices with exceptional accuracy.
  _Example use: When asking about token prices, market movements, or price correlations, Pond3r taps into Pyth's reliable price feeds._
- Handlefinder: Our gateway to decentralized social data from Farcaster and other social protocols, enabling insights into social trends, user activity, and community engagement.
  _Example use: When inquiring about social sentiment around projects, trending topics, or creator activity, Pond3r analyzes data from Handlefinder._
- Processed Data Storage: Our proprietary database containing pre-processed and aggregated data for complex analyses that would be inefficient to perform in real-time.
  _Example use: When requesting historical trends, APY calculations, or complex metrics that require data from multiple sources._
