openapi: 'GET /v1/protocols/data-available'
---

## Overview

The data-available endpoint provides a comprehensive list of all protocols, chains, and data sources that can be queried through the POND3R API. This endpoint is useful for:

- Discovering what data is available for querying
- Understanding which protocols and chains are supported
- Planning your queries based on available data sources

## Response Structure

The response includes several categories of available data:

### Protocols

A list of all supported protocols across different chains, including:

- DeFi protocols (e.g., Uniswap, Aave, Compound)
- NFT protocols (e.g., Cryptopunks, Art Blocks)
- Bridge protocols (e.g., Hop, Optimism Bridge)
- And many more

Each protocol entry includes:
- `name`: The protocol name
- `version`: The protocol version
- `chain_id`: The blockchain network where the protocol is deployed

### Farcaster Data

Access to various Farcaster-related data:
- Trending topics and tokens
- User casts and profiles
- Search functionality for casts and users
- Token mention tracking

### Market Data

Comprehensive market data capabilities:
- Token information (descriptions, market cap, volume)
- Price data (current and historical)
- Top gainers and losers
- Recently added cryptocurrencies

### Wallet Data

Wallet-related functionality:
- Token balance queries for any wallet address or ENS name

### ENS Data

ENS-specific functionality:
- Owner lookup for ENS names

## Usage Examples

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock title="Node.js" language="javascript">
  ```javascript
  const axios = require('axios');

  async function getAvailableData() {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get('https://api.pond3r.xyz/v1/protocols/data-available', {
        headers: {
          'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
        }
      });
      
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching available data:', error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock title="Python" language="python">
  ```python
  import requests

  def get_available_data():
      url = 'https://api.pond3r.xyz/v1/protocols/data-available'
      headers = {
          'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
      }
      
      try:
          response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
          response.raise_for_status()
          return response.json()
      except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
          print(f"Error fetching available data: {e}")
          raise
  ```
  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Cache the Response**: Since the available data sources don't change frequently, consider caching the response to reduce API calls.

2. **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling, especially for authentication errors.

3. **Regular Updates**: Check this endpoint periodically to stay informed about new data sources and protocols.

4. **Query Planning**: Use this information to plan your queries and ensure you're requesting data from supported sources.

<Warning>
  The list of available protocols and data sources may change over time. Always check the response for the most up-to-date information.
