description: 'Connect your AI agent directly to Pond3r datasets using the Model Context Protocol'
---

## Overview

Pond3r provides a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that lets AI agents query curated crypto datasets directly. The server uses **Streamable HTTP transport**, so it works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible client.

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Sign up at [makeit.pond3r.xyz](https://makeit.pond3r.xyz) if you haven't already.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate an API key">
    Go to [makeit.pond3r.xyz/api-keys](https://makeit.pond3r.xyz/api-keys) and generate a new key.

    <Warning>
      Keep your API key secure. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup with Claude Code

Run this command in your terminal to add the Pond3r MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add pond3r-data \
  --transport http \
  https://mcp.pond3r.xyz/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here"
```

The tools will be available immediately in your Claude Code session.

## Setup with Claude Desktop

Add the following to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration file (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pond3r": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.pond3r.xyz/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and the Pond3r tools will be available in your conversations.

## Setup with Cursor

In Cursor, go to **Settings** > **MCP Servers** and add a new server:

- **URL**: `https://mcp.pond3r.xyz/mcp`
- **Headers**: `Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here`

## Setup with Other Clients

For any MCP-compatible client that supports Streamable HTTP transport, send POST requests to:

```
https://mcp.pond3r.xyz/mcp
```

Pass your API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

## Available Tools

Once connected, your AI agent has access to three tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_datasets` | List all available datasets and their tables |
| `get_schema` | Get column names, types, and descriptions for a dataset |
| `query` | Execute a read-only SQL query against a dataset |

The agent will automatically discover schemas and available data — you just need to ask your question in natural language.

### Query Tool

The `query` tool executes read-only SQL against Pond3r datasets. A few things to note:

- **SELECT only** — write operations are not allowed.
- **Use bare table names** — e.g. `SELECT * FROM stablecoin_yields`, not fully qualified paths.
- **Results are capped at 10,000 rows** — use `LIMIT` or `WHERE` filters for large datasets.
- **Cost is estimated before execution** — queries that exceed your tier limits are rejected before running.


## Example Conversation

Once the MCP server is connected, you can ask your AI agent questions like:

```
What are the top 5 stablecoin yields on Ethereum right now?
```

```
Show me Polymarket trades from the last 24 hours with the highest volume.
```

```
Compare USDC yields across Aave and Compound on Arbitrum.
```

The agent will use the `list_datasets` and `get_schema` tools to understand what's available, then write and execute SQL via the `query` tool.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection refused or timeout">
    Make sure your API key is valid and correctly set. Check that your client is sending the `Authorization` header with every request.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Query rejected: use simple table names">
    The server requires bare table names (e.g. `stablecoin_yields`). Do not include project or dataset prefixes in your SQL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Usage limit exceeded">
    You've hit your daily or monthly spend cap. Wait for the limit to reset or upgrade your plan for higher limits.
