## Query Writing Tips

To get the best results from POND3R, follow these query writing tips:

1. **Be specific about timeframes**: Instead of "recently," specify "in the last 24 hours" or "this week"

2. **Specify chains and versions**: Mention which blockchain and protocol version you're interested in 

3. **One question at a time**: For complex analyses, start with basic questions and build up with follow-ups

4. **Use natural language**: Write as you would ask a person, not like a SQL query

5. **Specify metrics**: Clearly state which metrics you're interested in (volume, TVL, price, etc.)

6. **Provide context**: For follow-up questions, POND3R maintains conversation context, but being explicit helps

<Note>
POND3R is constantly learning and improving. If you don't get the exact answer you need, try rephrasing your question or being more specific.
