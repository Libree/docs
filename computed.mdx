## Computed data

Pond3r uses a combination of on-chain data, social data, and price data to compute the data that is used to create computed datasets.

### How It Works

Our computed data pipeline works by:

1. **Collecting raw data**: We aggregate data from multiple sources including on-chain transactions, price feeds, and social platforms
2. **Processing and transforming**: Raw data is cleaned, normalized, and structured for efficient querying
3. **Calculating metrics**: We compute complex metrics like APYs, correlations, and trends that would be inefficient to calculate in real-time
4. **Storing in optimized format**: Processed data is stored in a format optimized for quick retrieval based on natural language queries
5. **Regular updates**: Computed datasets are updated at regular intervals to ensure data freshness

### Supported Computed Data

Pond3r provides the following computed datasets:

| Dataset | Description | Update Frequency |
|:--------|:------------|:-----------------|
| Apys  | Apys for most of the yield protocols | Daily |
| Social Sentiment | Aggregated sentiment analysis from Farcaster and other social platforms | Daily |
| Most trade tokens on Farcaster | Most traded tokens on Farcaster | Daily |


Our AI will automatically determine when to use computed data versus fetching real-time data directly from on-chain sources.

### Benefits of Using Computed Data

- **Faster Response Times**: Pre-computed metrics avoid complex calculations during query time
- **Historical Trend Analysis**: Access patterns and changes over time that wouldn't be visible from current state alone
- **Cross-Protocol Insights**: Compare metrics across different protocols and chains standardized to the same methodology
- **Complex Calculations**: Access metrics that require significant computation (e.g., correlation analysis, risk metrics)
- **Reduced On-Chain Load**: Minimize the need for extensive on-chain queries for commonly requested data

If you need a specific computed dataset that isn't currently available, please let us know through our Discord community. We regularly expand our computed data offerings based on user requests.
